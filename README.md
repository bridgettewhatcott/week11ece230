## Lab Questions

### What is different between edge and level sensitive circuits?
Level sensitive circuits only store the value as long as the enable/clock signal is high. Edge sensitive circuits remain at the value that occured exactly when the 
clock/enable signal went high.

### Why is it important to declare initial state?
Without initial state, we don't have any way of knowing the state of any of our pieces within the memory system.

### What do edge sensitive circuits let us build?
We are able to build flipflops because level sensitive circuits didn't have the clock signal needed.
